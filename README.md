# portfolio_mw

This is the repo for my Portfolio page.  This will be an ongiong project, which I will continue to develop and add. Currently, this version is more of a template to begin adding projects to. So far, it contains a simplt nav bar, link gallery, contact links and a brief About Me. I hope to keep coming back and improving this repo as I continue lerning!

The screenshots below show the first version of my Portfolio page as viewed on a desktop. Please also find a link to the page directly too.
